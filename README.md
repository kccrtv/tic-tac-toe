# Bronze Stories - high priority for MVP
As a player	I want a 3x3 grid	so that I can fill out my X's or O's
As a player 1	I want an assignment of X	so that I can fill out my X moves
As a player 2	I want an assignment of X	so that I can fill out my O moves
As a scorekeeper I want	to keep score	so that the players know when the game ends and who is declared the winner

# Silver Stories - medium priority for MVP
As a player	I want to limit my moves to only empty grid spaces so that there's only a maximum of nine moves before the game is over

# Gold Stories - low priority for MVP
As a player	I want prompted that I've got three of my moves in a row so that I know if I won or lost
